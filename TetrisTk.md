# Another Tetris Clone? #

I read a blog somewhere that a decent programmer can write a Tetris clone in a about an hour. I guess I am not a decent programmer! This took me about 30+ hours off and on, over the course of a few months.

It's not perfect, and I might still tweak with it but functionally, it does what I wanted.

If you want to provide feedback, improvements etc... then go to it.

Thanks...
